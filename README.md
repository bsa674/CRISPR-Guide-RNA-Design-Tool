## Description

Castor is a tool designed to simplify the gRNA design process in Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-associated protein 9 (Cas9) projects. The platform identifies gRNA sequences from input FASTA files based on specified PAM patterns and ranks them by predicted performance using a pre-trained ML model. The outputs include **predicted efficacy scores** for guide RNAs (gRNAs), **annotated gRNA data with biological features** (e.g., GC content, entropy, Tm), and visualizations such as **efficacy score distributions**, feature correlations, and boxplots. The results are saved to a CSV file for further analysis, and detailed logs ensure reproducibility and debugging support.

## Functionalities

This Python-based pipeline is designed for CRISPR guide RNA (gRNA) analysis. Pandas and NumPy libraries were used for data handling, scikit-learn for preprocessing and predictions, and Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization. It employs a machine learning model to predict gRNA efficacy based on sequence features such as GC content, entropy, and melting temperature (Tm). Secondary features like k-mer encoding are also included for comprehensive analysis.

## Data Sources and Processing
The input data consists of gRNA sequences extracted from FASTA files, processed with a PAM pattern matching ( "NGG") to identify target sequences. Sequences are enriched with biological features and normalized using scikit-learn's StandardScaler for uniformity. Pre-trained machine learning models, such as ensemble methods, predict the efficacy of each gRNA, with results formatted for downstream analysis.

## Data Storage and Structure
Pandas DataFrames store the gRNA data, incorporating features such as sequence length, GC content, entropy, and PAM presence. Results, including predicted efficacy scores, are saved as CSV files to ensure compatibility with external tools.

## User Interface and Accessibility
Streamlit was used to create a user-friendly interface for uploading FASTA files and viewing the predictions.It allow users to customize experimental parameters and download results.

## Statistical Analysis and Model Performance
The efficacy prediction relies on robust statistical techniques and machine learning models. Metrics such as regression accuracy and feature importance are computed to validate model performance across multiple datasets.

## Visualizations
Comprehensive visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn include:

Histograms for predicted efficacy score distributions.
Correlation heatmaps of biological features.
Boxplots for key metrics like GC content and sequence entropy.

## Installation and Usage
